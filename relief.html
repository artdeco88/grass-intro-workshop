<h2>Red relief</h2>

There are also some ready-to-use tools similar to RRIM. The steps I used in GRASS GIS 7 to produce output which is very close to RRIM are:
<code><pre>
r.skyview (similar to openness used in the RRIM article)
r.slope.aspect (to compute slope)
r.colors for slope raster (change color table to):
0% white
100% red
Then use 'Add various raster layers' button and 'Add shaded map' (d.shadedmap)
Skyview raster is used as 'reliefmap' and the red slope as 'drapemap'.
</pre></code>
