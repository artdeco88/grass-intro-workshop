<h1>Shaded relief</h1>


<h2>Common shaded relief</h2>

Creation of shaded relief map has two steps. First, compute the shaded relief:
<code><pre>
r.shaded.relief input=elevation output=elevation_shade
</pre></code>

You can use the created raster right-away if you want gray shaded relief.
If you want to combine it with color, you can also add both rasters to
the Layer Manager and set opacity of the shaded relief. However, for the best
result use GRASS module to combine both rasters. Use Add shaded map item
in the toolbar (under Add other raster layers) or use the following:

<code><pre>
d.shadedmap relief=elevation_shade drape=elevation
</pre></code>

This has the advantage of not creating additional raster while enabling to
use the shaded relief in diffident ways. Alternatively, it is possible to use
create the shaded raster map with color as a separate raster.

We have used shaded relief raster for shading and elevation raster for the color,
however any combination of rasters can be used to achieve different results.

<p>
Note: Before GRASS GIS 7 will be released <em>r.shaded.relief</em> will be
renamed to <em>r.relief</em> and <em>d.shadedmap</em> to <em>d.shade</em>.
There is also new <em>r.shade</em> module available.


<h2>Different approach to shading</h2>

There are also some ready-to-use tools similar to RRIM. The steps I used in GRASS GIS 7 to produce output which is very close to RRIM are:
<code><pre>
r.skyview (similar to openness used in the RRIM article)
r.slope.aspect (to compute slope)
r.colors for slope raster (change color table to):
0% white
100% red
Then use 'Add various raster layers' button and 'Add shaded map' (d.shadedmap)
Skyview raster is used as 'reliefmap' and the red slope as 'drapemap'.
</pre></code>
